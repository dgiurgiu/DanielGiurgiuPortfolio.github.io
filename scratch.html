		<h2>Name Assignment</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/NameProject.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p> Use scratch to make an animation showing your name, give the letters 3 unique related. The program needs to run when the green flag is clicked. For extra credit, all the letters went back into place after the green flag is clicked.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Blocks: commands that trigger actions in scratch</li>
			<li>Conditional statements - used if statements to……</li>
			<li>Events: When green flag is clicked, when a certain key is pressed, etc.</li>
			<li>Loops: I used forever blocks to create continuous actions</li>
			<li>Conditional Statements: I used if statements to start actions that need another action to start it.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Computer Buying Project</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/ComputerBuying.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>For the computer buying project, we had to create a presentation to convince someone what computer to buy. We created four options based on the person’s needs. We covered topics such as memory, RAM, hard drives, and price.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Presentations in scratch: we learned how to present information using scratch pages as powerpoint slides</li>
			<li>Changing backgrounds: we had to change the backgrounds a lot for this presentation.</li>
			<li>Text on scratch: We had to use text and manipulate it to fit the project demands. We changed the color, style and size of the text.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Final Project</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/Tumbleweed.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>We had a choice to either do a game or a story for the final project. I chose to do a game. The game had to have levels, keep score, change time, and change stage. I incorporated all of these aspects and I created the sprites myself.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sensing: I learned how to add sensing blocks and incorporate them in my code, usually with if statements.</li>
			<li>Broadcasts: I learned how to use broadcasts by sending and receiving them, which prompted other actions to begin.</li>
			<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to……, I used a repeat until block to…….</li>
			<li>Variables: I had dealt with variables before, but in this project they were especially important. I used them to set the score and time.</li>
			<li>Looks: I used looks to hide and show the elements of the game at specific points.</li>
		</ul>
